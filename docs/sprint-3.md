# Sprint 3 — Business Intelligence

Source of truth: [architecture.md](./architecture.md) §17.

## Objectives

- Implement Place Details enrichment with ToS-compliant caching TTLs.
- Build the Website Analysis pipeline (HTTP-only, staged, SSRF-guarded) per §9.
- Build the modular, data-driven Lead Score engine and seed scoring ruleset per §10.
- Build the business detail page presenting analysis, explainable score, and Google Business signals.

## Deliverables

- Place Details enrichment (cached in `businesses.place_summary`, ~30-day TTL).
- Website Analysis pipeline: acquire (SSRF-guarded fetch) → parse (Cheerio) → metadata/SEO/CMS/tracking/social/schema-OG stages → robots.txt/sitemap.xml → SSL → assemble/validate → persist to `website_analyses`.
- SSRF guards: private/link-local/metadata IP blocking, redirect cap, size cap, timeout.
- Lead Score engine: `scoring_rules` + `scoring_rulesets` tables, sandboxed expression evaluator, explainable `breakdown`, versioned scoring via `lead_scores`.
- Seed scoring ruleset (initial published version).
- Business detail page: analysis results, explainable Lead Score, Google Business signals (rating, review count, category, presence).

**Working app milestone:** open a business, run analysis, get an explainable Lead Score.
